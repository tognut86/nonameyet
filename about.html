<div class="text">
    <p>Dear Mister Wirth,</p>
</div>
<div class="text">
<p>Thank you for processing my request.

I have transferred over the amount of 22.56€ for my week at the Große Kunstschau.</p>
</div>
<div class="text">
<p>I have a question regarding the contract. In clause 1.1 it states that the Ausstellungsraum is 12.5m². Please could you clarify whether the available space is 12.5m², or 13.25² as written in the Details zur Pacht.</p>
</div>
<div class="text">
    <p>You have asked for a description of my intended use of the rented area.</p>
<p>Having faced a number of financial barriers as an emerging artist residing in the increasingly expensive and gentrified city of Berlin, I have come to the conclusion that it would be a cost effective strategy to seek studio space on the outskirts of the city. Making use of the recently introduced 9 EUR ticket, I intend to transfer the contents of my current studio in a co-working space, to Worpswede in order to upgrade to a private studio space roughly double the size of my current one, and 2.44 € cheaper . </p>
</div>

<div class="text">
<p>For the duration of the pact I will occupy my studio on a 9-5 basis, producing multimedia art in the form of writing, video, collage and sound. The work produced will integrate and respond directly to the context and environment of the museum and its occupants as an ongoing collage.</p>
</div>

<div class="text">
<p>The advantages of this move will be threefold:</p>
<p>1) Cost effective.</p>
<p>2) Time and energy efficient: simultaneously a working process, an exhibition and a "CV booster". Ease of access compared to residencies and gallery applications.</p>
<p>3) Camping holiday: I will be sleeping in a tent in the surrounding area.</p>
</div>

<div class="text">
<p>It will be necessary for me to continue my current online Ausbildung in Web Development as part of my obligation to the Agentur fur Arbeit which takes place on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday evening from 18:30-21:30. As I understand it, the museum closes at 6pm, therefore I will undertake this responsibility in my nearby camp using a "mobile hotspot" - in the public space, sozusagen.</p>
</div>
<div class="text">
<p>The project has the provisional title of "No Name Yet", referring both to my status as an emerging artist, and the nature of the exhibition which is also emergent.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="text">
<p>I would be very happy to discuss any possible basic provisions (if at all possible) which the gallery could provide, such as a table and a chair. </p>
</div>
<div class="text">
<p>I think that is all for now. I wish you a very nice day and thank you in advance for your prompt and courteous reply. </p>
</div>
<div class="text">
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Thomas Mayer</p>
<p>Emerging Artist</p>
